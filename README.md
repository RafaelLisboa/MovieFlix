Netflix-based website layout
Using only React JS


## Install Project

First use the command
```
$ git clone < https://github.com/RafaelLisboa/MovieFlix >
```
Then we will enter the folder
```
$ cd MovieFlix/
```
It is necessary to create a file at the root of the project that will be responsible for managing the environment variables
```
$ touch .env
```
And now inside the created file add the variable ```REACT_APP_API_KEY```
#### Now you must create your account and get your Api key from the <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3"><img src="https://www.themoviedb.org/assets/2/v4/logos/v2/blue_short-8e7b30f73a4020692ccca9c88bafe5dcb6f8a62a4c6bc55cd9ba82bb2cd95f6c.svg" alt="themoviedb" width="100" /></a>
This way you will have your api key running along with the environment variables that the application is running on

That done we will install the dependencies used in npm

```
$ npm i
```
after

```
$ npm start
```
And ***ready***
